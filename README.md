# Arduino Experiments by a ~~N00b~~ _Computer Science Student_

### Documentation

My objective is to provide detailed hardware lists and circuit diagrams for 
each project; some may be simple enough to forgo the documentation for, but 
it's a good habit that could use some practicing. :)

Each subfolder will include documentation for that specific experiment.

Feel free to open an issue/comment on a commit if you have any questions.

### Hardware

Unless otherwise mentioned, all hardware used was included in the [Elegoo Super Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D8KOZF4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
